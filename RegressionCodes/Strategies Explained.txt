Strategy - 1:

0 --> 1 --> -1 --> 0 (After 3.00)

Takes 1 position when slope > BT
Takes -1 position when slope < ST

No New Positions taken after 3.00, existing positions are only squared-off.
At 3.28, all existing positions are force squared-off.


Strategy - 2:

0 --> 1 --> 0 --> -1 --> 0 
Takes 1 position when slope > BT
Returns to 0 position when slope < 0
Takes -1 position when slope < ST
Returns to 0 position when slope > 0

No New Positions taken after 3.15, existing positions are only squared-off.
At 3.28, all existing positions are force squared-off.
